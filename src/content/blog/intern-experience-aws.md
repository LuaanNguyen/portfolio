_ Note: I did sign an NDA, so I can’t go too deep into certain details—but I’ll do my best to capture the essence of it._

## Internship Search

I received my SDE Intern offer on January 1st, 2025, and accepted it just three days later, even though I was still in the middle of interviews with other companies. A few more offers came in afterward, but in the end, I chose Amazon.

Before Amazon, I’d had a mix of experiences working at startups and in a research lab at ASU, but never what I’d call a truly “formal” internship. At previous companies, I contributed heavily to their source code, but I was never given a defined project or paired with a mentor the way I was at Amazon.

At Amazon, you don’t get to pick your team. I was lucky to be placed in Amazon Bedrock, specifically on the [Bedrock Data Automation](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/bda/) team—a newly launched service with huge potential in the generative AI space.

## Seattle

Seattle was beautiful in the summer. It felt like a city built for exploration. But without a housing stipend, I wouldn’t have been able to afford living there. I ended up choosing a college summer housing option just five minutes from the office, sharing a room with another intern. It honestly felt like freshman year of college all over again.

As for expenses, I burned through my housing stipend faster than expected. I ate out almost every day, telling myself that avoiding cooking and doing dishes would free up time for other things. I tried [Haidilao](https://www.haidilao-inc.com/us) hotpot for the first time. Some of the best places I've tried were [Pho So Mot](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-so-1-seattle), [Chengdu Memory](https://www.chengdumemory.com/), and [Beecher's Handmade Cheese](https://beechershandmadecheese.com/).

## Social Life

The best part of the internship for me was meeting other interns. Living in university housing, I met so many people from different backgrounds—all of them kind, humble, and genuinely fun to be around. I had to step out of my comfort zone to connect with so many new faces, but it was absolutely worth it.

Our friend group ended up being about 16 people. Together, we went out explored every part of Seattle, bar-hopping in Capitol Hill and Udistrict, caught comedy shows, hiked Mount Rainier, and even took a weekend trip to Olympic National Park. By the end of the internship, I was genuinely sad to leave. But seeing everyone receive positive feedback from their managers gave me hope that our paths will cross again one day.

I also met interns from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Snowflake, etc. The stereotype that Amazon interns work very hard is definitely true. I think the work culture here naturally pushes us to spend more of our life in the office.

## Conclusion

I wrapped up my internship with a final presentation to my team and an adjacent sister team. It was around 50 people in total. Instead of focusing on the roadblocks I’d faced, I decided to highlight the different approaches we explored and ensure the audience understood the high-level design of the project.

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Both my manager and mentor expressed their interest in having me join full-time. In my last week, we held several working sessions with other engineers to push out additional results—proof that the project could actually be production-ready. I had been told early on that most intern projects never make it to production, so hearing that mine might was incredibly rewarding.

On my final day, I sent out thank-you messages on Slack to my team and the recruiting HR team, gave my last hugs, and returned my laptop.

_Thank you to my team at AWS for an incredible summer of learning and growth._
