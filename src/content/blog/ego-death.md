[Ego death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death) is often defined as a temporary loss of self, usually described in the context of altered states (like doing drugs)

Our ego is the drug.

It is the thing that keeps score. It's the quiet tightening when you see someone close to you move faster. The natural reflex to compare titles, progress, visibility. It feeds on proximity, on seeing what others have and asking why you do not. When that comparison becomes habitual, the sense of self becomes brittle, dependent on constant reinforcement.

Jealousy does not sharpen you. It makes you fragile. It pulls attention outward when the work demands inward focus. The ego insists that other people’s success diminishes you. In reality, it only reveals how much of your identity you have tied to comparison. People talk about ego death as something induced, something external. But the ego can undo itself without drugs, without spectacle.

To move forward in life, you must experience ego death.

Ego death doesn't have to be dramatic. It is a small surrender repeated. Choosing motion over measurement. Choosing depth over display. Allowing yourself to be unfinished without interpreting that as failure. Allowing yourself to be seen, to be hunted, to be ridiculed for not knowing things. Moving through challenges without internal resistance. Living unapologetically to yourself, immersed in the grand universe without needing to prove your place in it.

There is relief in that.
